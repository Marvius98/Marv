Welcome in our Trophy Request channel!

If you feel like you have earned one of the available Badges shown down below, obtain the @Trophy Hunter role by clicking on üèÜ and let us know by posting your evidence (typically a screenshot).

We will review these submissions a few times per week to grant you the role. Newly earned Badges will be shown in the trophy-room.

You can show off your badges on your profile card, visible with the $profile command in the #profile-setup channel amongst others.

Happy hunting!
